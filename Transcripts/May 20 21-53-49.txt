Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products such as goods and services is also any activity or enterprise entered into for profit. Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business. If the business acquire debt, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all.
